    <h1>
        <p style="color:red;">Chihuahu</p></h1>
    <p>The Chihuahua's history is convoluted, and many theories surround the origin of the breed. Both folklore and archaeological finds show that the breed has origins in Mexico. The most common theory is that Chihuahua is descended from the Techichi, a companion dog favored by the Toltec civilization in Mexico.[2] No records of the Techichi are available before the 9th century, although dog pots from Colima, Mexico, buried as part of the western Mexico shaft tomb tradition, which date back to 300 BC, are thought to depict Techichis</p>

    <h1>
        <p style="color:red;">Bulldog</p></h1>
        <p>The Bulldog,[4] [5] also known as the British Bulldog or English Bulldog, is a medium-sized dog breed. It is a muscular, hefty dog with a wrinkled face and a distinctive pushed-in nose.[6] The Kennel Club (UK), the American Kennel Club (US), and the United Kennel Club (US) oversee breeding records. Bulldogs are popular pets; they were the fifth most popular purebreed in the US in 2017 according to the American Kennel Club.[7]

            Bulldogs have a longstanding association with English culture, as the BBC wrote: "to many the Bulldog is a national icon, symbolising pluck and determination."[8] During World War II, Bulldogs were often likened to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his defiance of Nazi Germany.[9] When the English settled in the Americas, their Bulldogs came with them. Dedicated bulldog fanciers formed The Bulldog Club (England) in 1878, and the Bulldog Club of America in 1890.</p>
